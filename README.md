## 📌 Overview

This project models stochastic asset price evolution using simulation rather than relying solely on closed-form mathematics.

Thousands of random price paths are generated to approximate the expected payoff of an option, demonstrating:

* Law of Large Numbers in finance
* Numerical vs analytical pricing comparison
* Sensitivity to volatility, rate, and time
* Accuracy–performance tradeoffs in Monte Carlo models

---

## 📐 Mathematical Model

The asset price follows **Geometric Brownian Motion**:

[
S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t \cdot \exp\left((r-\tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\Delta t + \sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}Z\right)
]

Where:

* (S_t) → Current asset price
* (r) → Risk-free interest rate
* (\sigma) → Volatility
* (Z) → Standard normal random variable

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. Simulate (N) stochastic price paths
2. Compute terminal payoff ( \max(S_T-K,0) )
3. Average all simulated payoffs
4. Discount to present value
5. Compare estimate with analytical benchmark

        S0=100,        # Initial price
        K=100,         # Strike price
        r=0.05,        # Risk-free rate
        sigma=0.2,     # Volatility
        T=1.0,         # Time to maturity (years)
        paths=10000    # Number of simulations
    )
